# Three.js Journey

Using Bruno Simon's Fireworks Shaders Lesson 34 on (ThreeJs Journey)[https://threejs-journey.com/] to learn about animating particles on the vertex shader, and adding the (three.js example)[https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgpu_ocean.html] sky for ambience.

Taking it further:

- Adding more particles
- Adding default parameters to the createFirework function
- Adding more parameters to the default firework function
- Adding different coulours instead of uniform colours
- adding sound
- handling other shapes other than a sphere
- Adding a model and getting the fireworks to reflect off of an ocean
